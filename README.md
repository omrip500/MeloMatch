## 🎯 What is MeloMatch?

MeloMatch allows singers to simply start singing — and the app detects the song in real time and plays the matching playback **in the correct key** for the singer.  
No need to search YouTube for karaoke versions or manually adjust pitch. Just sing, and get accompanied.

---

## 🌱 Background

The idea came from a personal need —  
> "I love singing, but I’m not a professional. I wanted someone to accompany me — but my pianist friend isn’t always around. And the playbacks I find online? They’re often in the wrong key or take forever to find."

That’s when **MeloMatch** was born — a musical sidekick in your pocket.
